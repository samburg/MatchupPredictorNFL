# MatchupPredictorNFL

## If you want to run the model, you can download the play-by-play dataset from the following link (it is too big to upload here)
https://github.com/ryurko/nflscrapR-data/blob/master/play_by_play_data/regular_season/reg_pbp_2018.csv

### If you run the script, a new dataset will be created that contains the advanced statistics for each team upon every matchup in the 2018-19 NFL season. These advanced statistics are what trains the models for each matchup. The testing labels consist of a boolean variable of whether or not the 'Home Team' won.

### Three different classification techniques are employed here -- Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
